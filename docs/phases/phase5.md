### Phase 5: Pagination, cleanup and deployment (2 days)
 I will finish formatting the app with CSS/Bootstrap (in progress the whole way), a Pagination
 gem, and implement a demo login, and deployment recommendations:
  -Seed database
 -task to cleanout the database regularly and seed with good demo data.
 -avoid app shutting down on Heroku(Pingdom or New Relic)
 -new domain name
